# poker
This creates a poker game and evaluates what each hand is

TODO/IN PROGRESS: add call into game to choose what hand is the best/order the hands (function comparing two hands is done)

once functionality is implemented, I would like to look into making runtime more efficient (specifically with the comparison and evaluation of hands functions)


TODO: figure out why it's handling a second reqeust and printing it to the logs (on an api call, its logging like it ran the function twice instead of once)
